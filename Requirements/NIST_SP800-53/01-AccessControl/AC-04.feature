Feature: Information Flow Enforcement Policy

  Scenario: Restricting Information Flow
    Given a system with sensitive information
    When a user tries to transmit or access the sensitive information
    Then the system enforces information flow restrictions
    And the system prevents unauthorized transmission or access of the sensitive information

  Scenario: Data Classification
    Given a system with classified data
    When a user interacts with the system and accesses the data
    Then the system enforces data classification policies
    And the system ensures that users can only access data according to their authorized classification level

  Scenario: Data Loss Prevention
    Given a system with data loss prevention mechanisms
    When a user tries to transmit sensitive or confidential data
    Then the system scans the data for any policy violations or unauthorized content
    And the system blocks or alerts the user about potential data loss incidents

  Scenario: Encryption of Data in Transit
    Given a system that transmits data over a network
    When data is transmitted between systems or devices
    Then the system enforces encryption policies for data in transit
    And the system ensures that data is securely encrypted during transmission to prevent unauthorized access

  Scenario: Access Control for Data Repositories
    Given a system with data repositories or databases
    When a user requests access to a specific data repository
    Then the system enforces access control policies for the data repository
    And the system grants or denies access based on the user's credentials and permissions

  Scenario: Data Segregation and Isolation
    Given a system with multiple users and sensitive data
    When data is stored or processed in the system
    Then the system ensures segregation and isolation of data between different users or user groups
    And the system prevents unauthorized access or leakage of data across user boundaries

  Scenario: Audit Logging of Data Access
    Given a system with audit logging capabilities
    When data is accessed or modified by users
    Then the system logs the details of the data access or modification events
    And the audit log can be reviewed for accountability and monitoring purposes

  Scenario: Handling External Data Sources
    Given a system that integrates with external data sources
    When external data is imported or accessed by the system
    Then the system enforces policies for validating and sanitizing the external data
    And the system ensures that external data is processed securely and does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious content

  Scenario: Incident Response and Reporting
    Given a system with information flow enforcement policies
    When security incidents or policy violations occur
    Then the system triggers incident response procedures
    And the system generates reports or notifications for security incidents or policy violations

  Scenario: User Awareness and Training
    Given a system with information flow enforcement policies
    When users interact with the system
    Then the system provides user awareness and training materials on information flow policies
    And the system educates users about their responsibilities in ensuring proper information handling and flow
