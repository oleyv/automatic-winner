Feature: Mechanisms Implementing Terms and Conditions on the Use of External Systems
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mechanisms are in place to enforce terms and conditions on the use of external systems
  So that risks associated with external system usage are mitigated and compliance with organizational policies is ensured

  Scenario: Definition and communication of terms and conditions
    Given an organization with external system usage
    When defining terms and conditions for the use of external systems
    Then the organization should clearly articulate and document the terms and conditions in a policy or agreement
    And the organization should communicate the terms and conditions to all users who have access to or utilize external systems

  Scenario: Acknowledgment of terms and conditions
    Given an organization with external system usage
    When a user accesses or utilizes external systems
    Then the organization should require the user to acknowledge and accept the terms and conditions before accessing or utilizing the external systems
    And the organization should maintain records of user acknowledgments for audit and compliance purposes

  Scenario: Enforcement of terms and conditions
    Given an organization with external system usage
    When monitoring external system usage
    Then the organization should enforce compliance with the agreed-upon terms and conditions
    And the organization should identify and address any violations or non-compliance promptly
    And the organization should apply appropriate disciplinary actions or consequences for repeated or intentional violations

  Scenario: Periodic review of terms and conditions
    Given an organization with external system usage
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the organization should review and update the terms and conditions on a regular basis, considering changes in regulations, technologies, or organizational needs
    And the organization should communicate any updates or changes to the terms and conditions to all users in a timely manner

  Scenario: Training and awareness on terms and conditions
    Given an organization with external system usage
    When providing training and awareness programs
    Then the organization should educate users on the importance of complying with the terms and conditions
    And the organization should provide clear guidance on how to adhere to the terms and conditions when utilizing external systems
