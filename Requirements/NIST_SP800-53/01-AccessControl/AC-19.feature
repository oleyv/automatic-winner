Feature: Access Control Capability for Mobile Device Connections
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mobile device connections to organizational systems are properly controlled and secured
  So that risks associated with mobile device usage are mitigated and unauthorized access is prevented

  Scenario: Configuration of mobile device access controls
    Given a system with mobile device connectivity capability
    When configuring access controls for mobile devices
    Then the system should enforce strong authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics or complex passwords, to verify the user's identity
    And the system should enforce device-level encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data stored on mobile devices

  Scenario: Authorization and access restrictions for mobile devices
    Given a system with mobile device connectivity capability
    When a mobile device attempts to connect to an organizational system
    Then the system should verify the device's authorization status and access permissions
    And the system should enforce access restrictions based on the user's role, device compliance status, and other relevant factors

  Scenario: Remote wipe and lock capabilities for mobile devices
    Given a system with mobile device connectivity capability
    When a mobile device is lost, stolen, or compromised
    Then the system should have the capability to remotely wipe or lock the device to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data
    And the system should initiate the remote wipe or lock action promptly to minimize the potential impact of a security incident

  Scenario: Continuous monitoring of mobile device connections
    Given a system with mobile device connectivity capability
    When mobile devices are connected to organizational systems
    Then the system should continuously monitor mobile device connections for any suspicious activities or anomalies
    And the system should detect and report any security incidents or policy violations related to mobile device usage
    And the system should generate alerts or notifications to appropriate personnel for timely response and investigation

  Scenario: Regular assessment of mobile device access controls
    Given a system with mobile device connectivity capability
    When periodic assessments are conducted
    Then the system should assess the effectiveness of mobile device access controls, configurations, and policies
    And the system should identify any vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or deviations from the intended security requirements
    And the system should take appropriate actions to address the identified issues and improve the mobile device access controls
