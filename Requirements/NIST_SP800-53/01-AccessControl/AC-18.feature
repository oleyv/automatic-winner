Feature: Wireless Access Management Capability
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that the system has a robust wireless access management capability
  So that wireless access is properly controlled, monitored, and secured

  Scenario: Configuration of wireless access points
    Given a system with wireless access points (WAPs)
    When configuring WAPs
    Then the system should ensure that WAPs are securely configured with appropriate security settings, such as strong encryption protocols, unique SSIDs, and strong passwords
    And the system should enforce configuration standards and guidelines for all WAPs in the system

  Scenario: Authentication and encryption for wireless connections
    Given a system with wireless access capability
    When a user attempts to connect to a wireless network
    Then the system should require strong authentication mechanisms, such as WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3, to verify the user's identity
    And the system should encrypt the wireless connections using strong encryption protocols, such as AES, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted over the network

  Scenario: Segmentation and isolation of wireless networks
    Given a system with wireless access capability
    When configuring wireless networks
    Then the system should implement network segmentation to isolate wireless networks from each other and from the internal organizational network
    And the system should apply appropriate access controls and firewall rules to restrict communication between wireless networks and the internal network

  Scenario: Continuous monitoring of wireless networks
    Given a system with wireless access capability
    When wireless networks are in operation
    Then the system should continuously monitor the wireless networks for any unauthorized access attempts, rogue access points, or malicious activities
    And the system should detect and report any security incidents or policy violations related to wireless network usage
    And the system should generate alerts or notifications to appropriate personnel for timely response and investigation

  Scenario: Regular assessment of wireless security controls
    Given a system with wireless access capability
    When periodic assessments are conducted
    Then the system should assess the effectiveness of wireless security controls, configurations, and policies
    And the system should identify any vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or deviations from the intended security requirements
    And the system should take appropriate actions to address the identified issues and improve the wireless security controls

  Scenario: Configuration management for wireless access
    Given a system with wireless access capability
    When changes are made to the wireless access configurations
    Then the system should maintain a centralized and controlled repository for wireless access configurations
    And the system should ensure that changes to wireless access configurations are authorized, documented, and reviewed
