Feature: Mechanisms Implementing Least Privilege Functions
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mechanisms are in place to enforce least privilege functions
  So that users and processes have only the necessary privileges to perform their authorized tasks

  Scenario: User access rights
    Given a system with multiple users
    When a user is created or modified
    Then the system should assign access rights based on the user's job responsibilities
    And the system should ensure that each user has only the necessary privileges to perform their authorized tasks

  Scenario: Privilege escalation prevention
    Given a system with privileged actions or functions
    When a user attempts to escalate their privileges
    Then the system should prevent the privilege escalation attempt
    And the system should log the privilege escalation event
    And the system should take appropriate action, such as alerting the security team

  Scenario: Privilege separation for processes
    Given a system with multiple processes or applications
    When a process or application is executed
    Then the system should enforce privilege separation
    And the system should ensure that each process or application has only the necessary privileges to perform its intended functions
    And the system should prevent unauthorized access or modification of resources by processes or applications

  Scenario: Access control for system configuration
    Given a system with configuration settings
    When a user attempts to modify system configuration
    Then the system should enforce access control mechanisms for system configuration
    And the system should allow modification only by authorized users or roles
    And the system should log any configuration changes made by users

  Scenario: Principle of least privilege for remote access
    Given a system with remote access capabilities
    When a user attempts to access the system remotely
    Then the system should enforce the principle of least privilege for remote access
    And the system should grant remote access only with the minimum privileges necessary for the authorized task
    And the system should monitor and log remote access activities

  Scenario: Periodic privilege review
    Given an access control system with assigned privileges
    When periodic privilege reviews are conducted
    Then the system should generate a report of all user privileges and their associated functions
    And the system should compare the assigned privileges against the principle of least privilege
    And the system should identify any excessive or unnecessary privileges assigned to users
