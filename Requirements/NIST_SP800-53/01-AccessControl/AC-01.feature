Feature: Access Control Policy And Procedures
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that access control policies and procedures are implemented correctly
  So that unauthorized access to sensitive information can be prevented

  Scenario: User access control
    Given a system with sensitive information
    When a user requests access to the system
    Then the system should verify the user's identity and credentials
    And the system should grant access only if the user is authorized
    And the system should deny access if the user is not authorized

  Scenario: User access revocation
    Given a user with authorized access to the system
    When the user's access needs to be revoked
    Then the system should immediately disable the user's access privileges
    And the system should log the access revocation event
    And the system should notify the appropriate personnel about the access revocation

  Scenario: Access control review
    Given an access control policy and procedures in place
    When a periodic access control review is conducted
    Then the system should generate a report of all user accounts and their access privileges
    And the system should compare the access privileges against the approved access control policy
    And the system should highlight any discrepancies or violations found during the review

  Scenario: Account lockout
    Given a system with a maximum number of allowed login attempts
    When a user fails to provide valid credentials within the allowed attempts
    Then the system should lock the user's account temporarily
    And the system should notify the user about the account lockout
    And the system should generate an alert for the security team

  Scenario: Password complexity
    Given a system with password requirements
    When a user sets or changes their password
    Then the system should enforce password complexity rules, such as minimum length, character types, etc.
    And the system should reject weak passwords that do not meet the complexity requirements
    And the system should provide clear instructions to the user regarding the password complexity rules

  Scenario: Access control monitoring
    Given an access control system in place
    When a user accesses a sensitive resource
    Then the system should log the access event
    And the system should record relevant information, such as user ID, timestamp, accessed resource, etc.
    And the system should retain the access logs for a specified period of time
