Feature: Permitted Actions without Identification or Authentication
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that actions without proper identification or authentication are restricted and monitored
  So that unauthorized access or malicious activities can be prevented

  Scenario: Denial of unauthenticated access attempts
    Given a system with restricted resources or sensitive functions
    When an unauthenticated user attempts to access the restricted resources or functions
    Then the system should deny the access attempt
    And the system should provide a notification or error message indicating that authentication is required

  Scenario: Restriction of actions without authentication
    Given a system with actions or operations that require authentication
    When an unauthenticated user attempts to perform those actions
    Then the system should restrict the execution of the actions
    And the system should provide a notification or error message indicating that authentication is required to perform the action

  Scenario: Monitoring of unauthenticated access attempts
    Given a system with monitoring capabilities
    When an unauthenticated access attempt is made
    Then the system should log the event in the system logs
    And the system should include relevant information, such as source IP address, timestamp, and the type of access attempt
    And the system should generate alerts or notifications to appropriate personnel to investigate the unauthorized access attempt

  Scenario: Regular review of access logs for unauthorized access attempts
    Given a system with access logs
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should review and analyze the access logs for unauthorized access attempts
    And the system should identify any patterns or anomalies indicating potential security breaches or unauthorized activities
    And the system should take appropriate actions based on the log review findings, such as initiating further investigation or implementing additional security controls

  Scenario: Implementation of multi-factor authentication
    Given a system with sensitive resources or high-risk functions
    When access to those resources or functions is required
    Then the system should enforce multi-factor authentication
    And the system should require users to provide at least two independent factors, such as passwords, tokens, or biometric data, for successful authentication
