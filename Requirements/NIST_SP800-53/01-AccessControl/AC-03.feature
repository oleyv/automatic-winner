Feature: Access Control Policy

  Scenario: Granting Access
    Given a user with the appropriate role and permissions
    When the user requests access to a specific resource
    Then the system verifies the user's credentials and permissions
    And the system grants the user access to the requested resource

  Scenario: Denying Access
    Given a user with insufficient permissions
    When the user requests access to a specific resource
    Then the system verifies the user's credentials and permissions
    And the system denies the user access to the requested resource
    And an error message is displayed to the user

  Scenario: Role-Based Access Control
    Given a user with a specific role assigned
    When the user tries to access resources associated with their role
    Then the system allows access based on the user's role and associated permissions
    And the system denies access to resources not associated with the user's role

  Scenario: User-Based Access Control
    Given a user with specific access rights assigned
    When the user tries to access resources based on their access rights
    Then the system allows access based on the user's assigned access rights
    And the system denies access to resources not assigned to the user's access rights

  Scenario: Access Control Lists (ACLs)
    Given a resource with an associated Access Control List
    When a user requests access to the resource
    Then the system checks the user's credentials against the ACL
    And the system grants or denies access based on the ACL permissions

  Scenario: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
    Given a user requesting access to a resource
    When the user provides the necessary attributes (e.g., user role, location, time)
    Then the system evaluates the attributes against the access control policy
    And the system grants or denies access based on the attribute values

  Scenario: Access Control Policy Enforcement
    Given a system with access control policies defined
    When a user attempts to perform an action on a resource
    Then the system checks the user's credentials and permissions
    And the system enforces the access control policies to allow or deny the action

  Scenario: Access Control Policy Review
    Given an administrator responsible for access control policies
    When a change is made to an access control policy
    Then the system notifies the administrator about the policy change
    And the administrator reviews and approves the modified policy

  Scenario: Access Control Policy Logging
    Given a system with access control policy logging enabled
    When access control decisions are made for user requests
    Then the system logs the access control decisions and related details
    And the log can be reviewed for auditing and troubleshooting purposes

  Scenario: Access Control Policy Integration
    Given a system with multiple components or applications
    When access control policies are defined for each component or application
    Then the system integrates the access control policies across all components
    And the system enforces consistent access control rules throughout the system
