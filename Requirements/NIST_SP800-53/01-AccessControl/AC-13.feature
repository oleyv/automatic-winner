Feature: Supervision and Review - Access Control
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that access control policies and mechanisms are regularly supervised and reviewed
  So that any deviations, vulnerabilities, or inappropriate activities can be identified and addressed

  Scenario: Regular review of access control policies
    Given a system with access control policies in place
    When a specified time interval has elapsed
    Then the system should conduct a review of access control policies
    And the system should ensure that the policies are up-to-date, comprehensive, and aligned with organizational requirements
    And the system should involve relevant stakeholders, such as security personnel or system administrators, in the policy review process

  Scenario: Assessment of access control mechanisms
    Given a system with access control mechanisms implemented
    When periodic assessments are conducted
    Then the system should evaluate the effectiveness of the access control mechanisms
    And the system should identify any weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or deviations from the intended functionality
    And the system should take appropriate actions to address the identified issues and improve the access control mechanisms

  Scenario: Monitoring and reporting on access control activities
    Given a system with monitoring capabilities
    When access control activities occur, such as successful logins, failed logins, or access requests
    Then the system should monitor and record the access control activities in a log
    And the system should generate reports that provide insights into access control events and patterns
    And the system should enable system administrators or security personnel to review and analyze the access control activities

  Scenario: Review of access control logs
    Given a system with access control logs
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should review and analyze the access control logs
    And the system should identify any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts
    And the system should take appropriate actions, such as initiating further investigation or implementing additional security controls, based on the log review findings

  Scenario: Compliance with access control requirements
    Given a system with access control requirements defined by regulatory standards or organizational policies
    When compliance assessments are performed
    Then the system should ensure that the access control policies and mechanisms are in compliance with the defined requirements
    And the system should address any non-compliance issues through remediation or corrective actions
