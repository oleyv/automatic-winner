Feature: Access Authorizations Supporting Information-Sharing/User Collaboration Decisions
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that access authorizations for information-sharing and user collaboration decisions are implemented effectively
  So that authorized users can securely access and collaborate on shared information

  Scenario: Definition of access authorization requirements
    Given an organization with information-sharing and user collaboration needs
    When defining access authorization requirements for shared information
    Then the organization should identify the specific access levels and permissions required for different user roles or groups
    And the organization should document and communicate these access authorization requirements to all relevant personnel

  Scenario: Automated mechanisms for access authorization
    Given a system supporting information-sharing and user collaboration
    When granting access to shared information
    Then the system should provide automated mechanisms for access authorization, such as role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    And the system should enforce access authorization decisions based on the defined requirements and policies

  Scenario: Manual process for access authorization
    Given a system supporting information-sharing and user collaboration
    When granting access to shared information
    Then the system should provide a manual process for access authorization in cases where automated mechanisms are not feasible or appropriate
    And the system should ensure that the manual process follows established procedures and involves appropriate levels of review and approval

  Scenario: Regular review of access authorizations
    Given a system supporting information-sharing and user collaboration
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should regularly review access authorizations for shared information to ensure they remain aligned with the defined requirements and policies
    And the system should identify and address any unauthorized access or excessive permissions promptly

  Scenario: Audit and monitoring of access authorizations
    Given a system supporting information-sharing and user collaboration
    When users access and collaborate on shared information
    Then the system should generate audit logs and monitor access authorizations to detect any suspicious activities or policy violations
    And the system should generate alerts or notifications to appropriate personnel for timely response and investigation
