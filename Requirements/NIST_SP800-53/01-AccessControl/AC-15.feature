Feature: Automated Marking
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that sensitive information is automatically marked and appropriately labeled
  So that the information can be identified, protected, and controlled based on its sensitivity

  Scenario: Automated marking of sensitive information
    Given a system with sensitive information stored or processed
    When new information is created or received
    Then the system should automatically apply appropriate markings and labels to the information based on its sensitivity
    And the system should consider factors such as classification level, data type, or handling requirements to determine the appropriate markings

  Scenario: Consistent marking across different information types
    Given a system with different types of information, such as documents, emails, or database records
    When the system automatically applies markings to the information
    Then the system should ensure consistent marking across different information types
    And the system should follow predefined marking rules or policies to maintain consistency and accuracy in marking

  Scenario: Review and validation of automated markings
    Given a system with automated marking capability
    When automated markings are applied to sensitive information
    Then the system should provide a review and validation mechanism for the markings
    And the system should allow authorized users to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of the markings
    And the system should enable users to correct or modify the markings if necessary

  Scenario: Protection and preservation of markings
    Given a system with marked sensitive information
    When the information is stored, transmitted, or processed
    Then the system should ensure that the markings are protected and preserved throughout the information lifecycle
    And the system should prevent unauthorized modification, removal, or tampering of the markings
    And the system should apply appropriate security controls to safeguard the integrity and authenticity of the markings

  Scenario: Integration with access control and security mechanisms
    Given a system with access control and security mechanisms in place
    When sensitive information is marked and labeled
    Then the system should integrate the markings with access control policies and mechanisms
    And the system should enforce appropriate access restrictions and security controls based on the markings
    And the system should prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or dissemination of the marked information
