Feature: Remote Access
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that remote access to organizational systems is secure and properly controlled
  So that risks associated with remote connections are mitigated and unauthorized access is prevented

  Scenario: Secure remote access authentication
    Given a system with remote access capability
    When a user attempts to authenticate for remote access
    Then the system should require strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication or digital certificates, to verify the user's identity
    And the system should enforce password complexity requirements to ensure secure authentication

  Scenario: Encryption of remote access sessions
    Given a system with remote access capability
    When a remote connection is established
    Then the system should encrypt the remote access session using secure protocols, such as TLS/SSL, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted during the session
    And the system should use strong encryption algorithms and key management practices to ensure the security of the encrypted session

  Scenario: Logging and monitoring of remote access sessions
    Given a system with remote access capability
    When remote access sessions are established
    Then the system should log relevant information, such as user ID, source IP address, timestamp, and duration of the remote session
    And the system should monitor the remote access sessions for any suspicious activities or anomalies
    And the system should generate alerts or notifications to appropriate personnel in case of detected security incidents or policy violations

  Scenario: Enforcement of access control policies for remote access
    Given a system with remote access capability
    When a user attempts to access organizational resources remotely
    Then the system should enforce access control policies to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested resources
    And the system should apply appropriate access restrictions and permissions based on the user's role and privileges

  Scenario: Regular review of remote access controls
    Given a system with remote access capability
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should review and assess the effectiveness of remote access controls, policies, and mechanisms
    And the system should identify any vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or deviations from the intended security requirements
    And the system should take appropriate actions to address the identified issues and improve the remote access controls
