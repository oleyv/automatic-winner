Feature: Concurrent Session Control
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that users' concurrent sessions are controlled and limited
  So that unauthorized access and misuse of resources can be prevented

  Scenario: Enforcing limit on concurrent user sessions
    Given a system with user authentication mechanism
    When a user attempts to log in while having an active session
    Then the system should enforce a limit on concurrent user sessions
    And the system should prevent the user from starting a new session until the active session is terminated

  Scenario: Notifying users about active sessions
    Given a system with user authentication mechanism
    When a user successfully logs in to the system
    Then the system should display information about the user's active session(s)
    And the system should provide details such as login time, IP address, and session duration
    And the system should allow the user to terminate any active session if desired

  Scenario: Alert generation for multiple concurrent sessions
    Given a system with a threshold for maximum concurrent sessions per user
    When a user exceeds the threshold by starting additional sessions
    Then the system should generate an alert or notification
    And the system should include relevant information, such as user ID and the number of concurrent sessions
    And the system should take appropriate action, such as terminating the extra sessions or initiating additional security measures

  Scenario: Periodic review of concurrent session activity
    Given a system with recorded concurrent session information
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should generate a report of users' concurrent session activity
    And the system should analyze the session patterns and identify any anomalies or suspicious activities
    And the system should take appropriate actions based on the analysis, such as terminating unauthorized sessions or implementing additional security controls

  Scenario: Logging of concurrent session control events
    Given a system with log management capability
    When a user starts or terminates a session
    Then the system should log the concurrent session control event in the system logs
    And the system should include relevant information, such as user ID, timestamp, session start/termination action, and session details
