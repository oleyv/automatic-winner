Feature: Security Attributes
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that security attributes are associated with information and system resources
  So that access control decisions can be made based on the attributes and sensitive information can be appropriately protected

  Scenario: Association of security attributes with information
    Given a system with sensitive information
    When new information is created or received
    Then the system should associate appropriate security attributes with the information
    And the system should consider factors such as classification level, data sensitivity, or handling requirements to determine the appropriate attributes

  Scenario: Association of security attributes with system resources
    Given a system with different types of system resources, such as files, databases, or network devices
    When new resources are created or added to the system
    Then the system should associate appropriate security attributes with the resources
    And the system should consider factors such as resource sensitivity, criticality, or access requirements to determine the appropriate attributes

  Scenario: Consistent use of security attributes
    Given a system with security attribute association capability
    When security attributes are associated with information and system resources
    Then the system should ensure consistent use of security attributes across the system
    And the system should follow predefined rules or policies to maintain consistency and accuracy in attribute association

  Scenario: Review and validation of security attributes
    Given a system with security attributes associated with information and system resources
    When access control decisions are made based on the attributes
    Then the system should provide a review and validation mechanism for the attributes
    And the system should allow authorized users to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of the attributes
    And the system should enable users to correct or modify the attributes if necessary

  Scenario: Integration with access control and security mechanisms
    Given a system with access control and security mechanisms in place
    When security attributes are associated with information and system resources
    Then the system should integrate the attributes with access control policies and mechanisms
    And the system should enforce appropriate access restrictions and security controls based on the attributes
    And the system should prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information based on the attribute-based access control decisions
