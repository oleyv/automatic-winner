Feature: System Use Notification
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that users are notified about the system's acceptable use policies
  So that they are aware of their responsibilities and any restrictions when using the system

  Scenario: Displaying system use notification upon login
    Given a system with user authentication mechanism
    When a user successfully logs in to the system
    Then the system should display a system use notification message
    And the system should present the acceptable use policies and guidelines
    And the system should require the user to acknowledge the notification before proceeding

  Scenario: Periodic display of system use notification
    Given a system with active user sessions
    When a specified time interval has elapsed
    Then the system should display the system use notification message to currently logged-in users
    And the system should present the acceptable use policies and guidelines again
    And the system should require the users to acknowledge the notification

  Scenario: User awareness training on system use policies
    Given a system with user accounts
    When new user accounts are created
    Then the system should require the users to undergo user awareness training on system use policies
    And the system should track and record the completion of the training for each user
    And the system should enforce the completion of refresher training at specified intervals

  Scenario: Audit logging of system use notification acknowledgement
    Given a system with audit logging capability
    When a user acknowledges the system use notification
    Then the system should record the user's acknowledgement event in the audit logs
    And the system should include relevant information, such as user ID, timestamp, and the acknowledgment action

  Scenario: Review of system use notification effectiveness
    Given a system with system use notification implemented
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should evaluate the effectiveness of the system use notification
    And the system should assess user compliance with the acceptable use policies
    And the system should identify any areas for improvement or necessary updates to the notification
