Feature: Mechanisms Implementing Separation of Duties Policy
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mechanisms are in place to enforce separation of duties policy
  So that conflicts of interest and unauthorized actions can be prevented

  Scenario: User role assignment
    Given a system with multiple user roles defined
    When a user is assigned a role
    Then the system should ensure that the assigned role is appropriate for the user's job responsibilities
    And the system should prevent the assignment of conflicting roles to the same user

  Scenario: Role-based access control
    Given a system with role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
    When a user attempts to perform an action
    Then the system should check if the user's assigned role allows the action
    And the system should deny the action if the user's role does not have the necessary privileges

  Scenario: Approval process for privileged actions
    Given a system with privileged actions identified
    When a user requests to perform a privileged action
    Then the system should require an approval process for the action
    And the system should involve a separate authorized individual or role in the approval process
    And the system should log the approval process and associated decisions

  Scenario: Audit trail for privileged actions
    Given a system with privileged actions performed by authorized users
    When a privileged action is executed
    Then the system should create an audit trail of the action
    And the system should record relevant information, such as user ID, timestamp, action performed, etc.
    And the system should retain the audit logs for a specified period of time

  Scenario: Monitoring for role violations
    Given a system with defined roles and associated access privileges
    When a user attempts to perform actions outside their assigned role
    Then the system should generate an alert or notification
    And the system should log the role violation event
    And the system should take appropriate action, such as notifying the user's supervisor or security team

  Scenario: Periodic access reviews
    Given an access control system with role assignments
    When periodic access reviews are conducted
    Then the system should generate a report of all user roles and their associated permissions
    And the system should compare the role assignments against the separation of duties policy
    And the system should identify any violations or conflicts in the role assignments
