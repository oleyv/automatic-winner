Feature: Management of Publicly Accessible Content
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mechanisms are in place to effectively manage publicly accessible content
  So that the content is accurate, up-to-date, and aligned with organizational policies and requirements

  Scenario: Content review and approval process
    Given a system with publicly accessible content
    When creating or updating content for public access
    Then the system should enforce a content review and approval process
    And the system should ensure that authorized personnel review and approve the content before it is published or made publicly available

  Scenario: Version control and change management
    Given a system with publicly accessible content
    When making changes to the content
    Then the system should maintain version control and track changes to the content
    And the system should allow authorized personnel to easily revert to previous versions if needed
    And the system should enforce change management processes to document and manage content modifications

  Scenario: Timely and accurate content updates
    Given a system with publicly accessible content
    When updates or corrections are required
    Then the system should ensure that content updates are made in a timely manner
    And the system should enforce procedures to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the updated content
    And the system should provide mechanisms to inform users about content changes or updates

  Scenario: Access controls for publicly accessible content
    Given a system with publicly accessible content
    When granting access to the content
    Then the system should enforce appropriate access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals can modify or publish the content
    And the system should enforce access restrictions based on the user's role or permissions

  Scenario: Monitoring and removal of inappropriate content
    Given a system with publicly accessible content
    When monitoring the content
    Then the system should continuously monitor the content for any inappropriate, offensive, or non-compliant materials
    And the system should have mechanisms in place to promptly remove or take corrective actions against such content
    And the system should maintain audit logs of content monitoring and removal activities for accountability and compliance purposes
