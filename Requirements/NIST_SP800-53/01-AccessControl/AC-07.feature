Feature: Unsuccessful Login Attempts
  As a system administrator
  I want to ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and respond to unsuccessful login attempts
  So that potential unauthorized access can be detected and mitigated

  Scenario: Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
    Given a system with a maximum number of allowed login attempts
    When a user fails to provide valid credentials within the allowed attempts
    Then the system should lock the user's account temporarily
    And the system should notify the user about the account lockout
    And the system should generate an alert for the security team

  Scenario: Capturing and logging unsuccessful login attempts
    Given a system with user authentication mechanism
    When a user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials
    Then the system should capture and log the unsuccessful login attempt
    And the system should record relevant information, such as user ID, timestamp, source IP address, etc.
    And the system should retain the logs for a specified period of time

  Scenario: Alert generation for multiple unsuccessful login attempts
    Given a system with a threshold for multiple unsuccessful login attempts
    When a user exceeds the threshold within a specified timeframe
    Then the system should generate an alert or notification
    And the system should include relevant information, such as user ID, source IP address, etc.
    And the system should take appropriate action, such as blocking the source IP address or initiating additional security measures

  Scenario: Analysis and response to repeated unsuccessful login attempts
    Given a system with a history of unsuccessful login attempts
    When multiple unsuccessful login attempts are detected from the same source
    Then the system should analyze the patterns and frequency of the attempts
    And the system should correlate the attempts with other security events or indicators
    And the system should respond by implementing appropriate countermeasures, such as IP blocking, increased authentication requirements, or alerting the security team

  Scenario: Periodic review and analysis of unsuccessful login attempts
    Given a system with recorded unsuccessful login attempts
    When periodic reviews are conducted
    Then the system should generate a report of the unsuccessful login attempts
    And the system should analyze the trends and patterns of the attempts
    And the system should identify any anomalies or suspicious activities
    And the system should take appropriate actions based on the analysis, such as updating security controls or user awareness training
